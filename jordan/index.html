        Orbiting this at a distance of roughly ninety-eight million miles

      <p>I have always loved reading (thanks to my mom) and I love scifi books.
        Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy really is the book (along with my passion
        for space) that ignited my love for scifi books. To this day, I read as
        many scifi books as I can. That is why I started with the opening lines of
        the book. </p>

        I've been spending a lot of time in my room. A year ago, I took out everything that didn't bring productivity or happiness to me. Now, it seems pretty boring (according to the people I live with). It has a small Ikea desk with a nice little
        plant on it, and this is where I code all the time. I have a small nightstand with a drawer on the bottom, and that's where I have my record player (on top) and the records (in the drawer). Next to it, I have my bed, which takes up most of
        the space in my room. That's it...</p>

      <p>1. A pen is wiser, it must know what it is doing before it does it because it cannot be erased.</p>
      <p>3. A clock is smarter because it intentionally has (more) parts in it so it can function.</p>
      <p>4. A question is easier to teach because you can continue on the chain of "unknowingness." That doesn't
        mean that it's always the best thing to do.</p>
      <p>6. The past is a scary thing, but (especially in driving) looking back is even more dangerous if you're supposed
        to be looking ahead.</p>
      <p>7. Both are a promise because mathematics is the language of the universe, and science will help us
        discover that universe. (p.s. engineering is the best because it's both)</p>
      <p>10. This is a tough one, but I think an exit has more pride because you must have the pride to walk in
        already, so walking out is even more prideful.</p>
      <p>11. A mirror is more like a legend, it's a piece of glass that can reflect whatever it sees.</p>
      <p>13. Ohio has the worst weather, so both because that probably means the other one might happen right after
        and then a tornado shows up to just ruin the day.</p>
      <p>14. An autograph has less charm because it came from someone who probably didn't want to sign an autograph.</p>

      <p>[June 24, 2019 - June 25, 2019 at like 2AM]</p>
      <p>SpaceX is getting ready to launch STP-2 on their Falcon Heavy rocket (the one that has 2 landing boosters). We
        made the trip down to Daytona Beach specifically for this event, so I was as ready as I would ever be. We toured
        Kennedy Space Center (for the second time) until around 10PM. The launch was supposed to happen at around 11:30PM,
        but it was pushed back until around 2AM the next day. During this time, I slept on a cooler outside the car, trying
        to stay awake and not get bitten by mosquitoes.</p>

        <p>My family was in the car, turning the air conditioning on for a bit, then off, trying to stay cool.
           Eventually, it launched and I almost had a heart attack because I was so excited (and quite tired).
           As an aspiring aerospace engineer, that day will probably stick with me for the rest of my life.</p>
